# Flyte Tutorial: DeveloperWeek Latin America 2023

This directory contains the workshop materials for [DeveloperWeek Latin America 2023](https://www.developerweek.com/latin-america/).

## Build Production-Grade Machine Learning and Data Workflows with Open-Source Tooling

### Abstract

Teams looking to extract valuable insights from data and efficiently run machine learning workflows will encounter several challenges such as navigating a fragmented tool ecosystem, complex infrastructure setup, scaling up compute resources at a granular level, and enabling team collaboration.

Flyte is an open-source solution for data and ML workflow orchestration that simplifies the process of collaborating, scaling, and deploying these workflows. Flytekit, the Python SDK for Flyte, enables data and ML teams to write business logic as isolated tasks, compose them into more complex workflows, share them within teams, and horizontally/vertically scale compute resources.

In this session, attendees will explore first principles with Flyte, and discover how to design and deploy end-to-end workflows incorporating production-grade orchestration features like caching, data lineage, local debugging, reusability and deployment to Kubernetes. They will learn how to author pipelines by composing tasks together into workflows, see how Pythonâ€™s typing module can be used to provide strong type guarantees and out-of-the-box data lineage tracking, and gain an understanding of how reproducibility can be attained. 

## Setup

Follow the **Flyte Sandbox** instructions to use the fully-managed prototyping
environment hosted by [Union.ai](https://www.union.ai/), or the **Local**
instructions if you want to run a Flyte cluster on your local machine.

### Flyte Sandbox

Go to https://sandbox.union.ai and create an account via Github or Google. Then,
click **Start Sandbox**. This will take 1-2 minutes to launch.

In the terminal, clone this repo and go to the workshop directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte-conference-talks
cd flyte-conference-talks/devweek-latinamerica-2023
```

Install dependencies with

```
make sandbox-setup
```

To make sure everything's working, run

```
python workflows/example_00_intro.py
```

Expected output:

```
DefaultNamedTupleOutput(o0=LogisticRegression(C=0.1, max_iter=5000.0), o1=0.989010989010989, o2=1.0)
```

### Local

Clone this repo and go to the workshop directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte-conference-talks
cd flyte-conference-talks/devweek-latinamerica-2023
```

Create a virtual environment

```
python -m venv ~/venvs/devweek-latinamerica-2023
source ~/venvs/devweek-latinamerica-2023/bin/activate
```

[Install Flytectl](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/flytectl/en/latest/#installation),
then run this command to start a Flyte demo cluster and install local dependencies

```
make local-sandbox-setup
```

And you're good to go!
